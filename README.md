# Generalizing Verifiable Instruction Following

This repo contains IFBench, which is a new, challenging benchmark for precise instruction following. 

## IFBench
IFBench consists of two parts:

- OOD Constraints: 58 new and challenging constraints, with corresponding verification functions. The constraint templates are combined with prompts from a held-out set of WildChat (Zhao et al. 2024).

- (optionally) Multiturn Constraint Isolation in 2 turns: The prompt and the constraint are separated over two turns, i.e. the first turn is the user prompt and the model's response to the prompt, and the second turn is the constraint that modifies the initial prompt.

- New IF-RLVR training constraints: 29 new and challenging constraints, with corresponding verification functions. 


## How to run inference in the simplest way possible with any temperature-supporting llm provider via litellm


```
python run_ifbench_inference_litellm.py --model gpt-4.1

python run_ifbench_inference_litellm.py --model fireworks_ai/accounts/patronusai/deployedModels/qwen3-4b-n70prh6y
```

Note that certain LLMs like o3 and gpt-5 no longer take in a temperature parameter. You can comment that line out when running them. We need better toggling on that via argparse which we will do in the future. 

## How to run the evaluation
Install the requirements via the requirements.txt file.
You need two jsonl files, one the IFBench_test.jsonl file (in the data folder) and one your file with eval prompts and completions (see sample_output.jsonl as an example). Then run:
```
python3 -m run_eval --input_data=IFBench_test.jsonl --input_response_data=sample_output.jsonl --output_dir=eval
```

## Released Datasets
You can find our released datasets in this [collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/allenai/ifbench-683f590687f61b512558cdf1), which contains the [test data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/IFBench_test), the [multi-turn test data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/IFBench_multi-turn) and the [IF-RLVR training data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/IF_multi_constraints_upto5).

## RLVR for Precise Instruction Following
We also release our IF-RLVR code, as part of [open-instruct](https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct). You can run this [GRPO script](https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct/blob/main/open_instruct/grpo_fast.py), using our [training data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/IF_multi_constraints_upto5). This is an [example command](https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct/blob/main/scripts/train/rlvr/valpy_if_grpo_fast.sh).

The new training constraints and verification functions are here: https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct/tree/main/open_instruct/IFEvalG
